# When did you first start working on this week's learning challenges?

Monday (I did all the d3 stuff), but I started the others Wednesday
as soon as I could after they were posted.

# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

Figuring out mongo challenge 3. I'm not sure we had any context.  It could've been done one way I know
(.distinct()) but that didn't match your format.  I couldn't figure anything out until I scoured the internet
for a while to match your solution.  The aggregate was cool though.

## Challenge 2 (8 points)

My analysis is meant to examine when the actual game was being played
(e.g. users clicking for kisses or whatever), first I examined the number of touches
vs. the time since start, searching for gaps, which seem to occur
between 200,000 ms and 250,000 ms, and 400,000 and 450,000 ms.

Then, just to ensure people's apps didn't crash at those points and the
data is just showing when people stopped playing, I examined the
number of records (there shouldn't be any records after the app is quit).
![screenshot](ml/ch2b.png?raw=true)
This image shows mostly as expected, especially the first and last gaps,
signaling that this is when the users are not playing the game - at least
not touching the screen consistently across users.

It seems this dataset only contains one, a personal favorite of mine:
"Mike Todd's Raw Body Boot Camp"
