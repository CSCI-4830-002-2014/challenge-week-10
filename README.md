## Challenge 2 (8 points)

{Looking through the data, I compared the count of the touch labels for each 
student ID, with how long it had been since the start. I found a pretty 
simple observation, that the number of touch events was almost directly
proportional to the lenght of time since start. Those that had low touch counts
also had very low time counts. }
