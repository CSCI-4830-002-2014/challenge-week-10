# 4. (5 points)

> db.runCommand ( { distinct: "aid", key: "flow_type", query: {'disbursement_amount': {$gt:100000000}}})

Respons: n refers to the number of records in a collection that match the query. The second query has a much lower n than the first because it is only counting records with a disbursement amount greater than $100,000,000
