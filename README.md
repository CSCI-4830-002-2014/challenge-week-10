# Show and tell (6 points)

## Link (2 points)

[Inequality and the Human Development Index](http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/401461)

## Write down TWO D3 features youâ€™d like to learn next . (4 points)

I would like to learn more about:

1) How to create a visualization that follows real-time data (if at all possible).

2) How to get D3 and SQL to play together.

> db.runCommand(distinct: "aiddata", key: "flow_type");

# 4. (5 points)

> db.runCommand({distinct: "aiddata", key: "flow_type", query: {"disbursement_amount": {$gt: 100000000} } });

"n" is the number of records that have one of these types. "n" is much smaller for the query in challnege 4 than in challenge 3 because not many of the records have disbursement amounts over $100,000,000.00 .
