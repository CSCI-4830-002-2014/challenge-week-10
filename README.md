## Challenge 2 (8 points)

Here I have created a visualization that analyzes the time each student took to complete the task by color,
while the bar height represents how many touches they made during the test. We can see that the greener bars 
are also the shortest bars with regard to height, which would be expected. The shorter the duration of taking 
the test, the fewer touches were made.
